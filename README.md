# Hi~
I've been exposed to computers since I was young and developed a strong interest in programming.

I started with simple **VB Script** and **Batch scripts**, then moved on to **VB6**, and later learned the **front-end trio (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)** along with **Node.js**.

Recently, I've been trying to learn **Python** and **cybersecurity** ~~(although it seems my Python skills have hit a plateau XD)~~.

I believe the most important thing in programming is continuous improvement, learning excellent coding styles, *and learning from others' strengths to compensate for my weaknesses*
